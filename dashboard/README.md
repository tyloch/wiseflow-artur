**A complete user-side API is planned for version V0.3.9. Currently, this is for reference only**

The API does not directly connect with the Core. The API operates on data storage (including user settings storage), so this does not affect your direct use of the core.

The initial version of the API is expected to include:

- CRUD operations for information sources;
- CRUD operations for points of interest;
- Reading and searching insights;
- Reading and searching articles;
- Basic report generation functionality;
- Translation of original materials, etc.
